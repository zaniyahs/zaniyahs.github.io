When I first started at UH Mānoa, the Naval unit was still in that awkward "new kid" phase. It was only three years old, and we hadn’t even commissioned our first officer yet, so there was no "old guard" to tell us how things were supposed to look. Being a freshman in such a young program meant we weren't just joining a unit; we were basically the guinea pigs for every new tradition. It was a bit surreal realizing that everything we did—from how we ran drills to how we organized ourselves—was setting the tone for every student who would come after us.

The best example of that "figure it out as you go" energy was the very first Navy Ball. Since it had never been done at Mānoa before, I jumped in to help with a little bit of everything—food, music, decor, you name it. It was honestly a bit of a mess at first because we didn't have a playbook or any past photos to look at for inspiration. We were just a group of students trying to pull off a massive, formal event with no roadmap. But seeing it all come together that night was incredible. We ended up having a blast, and it’s pretty cool to think that the ball everyone goes to now started with us just trying to find our way in the dark.
