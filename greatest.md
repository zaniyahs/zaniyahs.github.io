Since 2012, my cousin has been running a nonprofit called Donte’s Gift Express to give back to the community back home. He grew up in East Cleveland, which is one of the toughest areas in Ohio, and he saw firsthand how many families struggle to put anything under the tree for Christmas. To help out, he started this massive three-day event. It kicks off with a huge shopping spree at Five Below and Walmart where we basically clear out the toy aisles. The second day is a giant gift-wrapping party at the Salvation Army with hundreds of volunteers, food, and music. Then, on day three, everyone hits the streets, knocking on doors and surprising families with gifts so no kid wakes up empty-handed.

In 2025, I stepped up to help on the finance committee. It was a side of the project I hadn’t handled before, focusing on gathering funds and figuring out exactly how to allocate the budget. I had to make sure we were balancing the spending perfectly—maximizing the number of toys we could buy while still making sure there was enough to cover the logistics and food for the volunteers. It was a lot of behind-the-scenes work, but seeing the whole thing come together on that third day made all the budgeting worth it. Being part of something that started in East Cleveland and grew into such a huge annual tradition is something I’m really proud of.
