When I joined the basketball team, the program was in a pretty rough spot. It had been over ten years since the school had even seen a final, so we were basically rebuilding from the ground up. My freshman year was all about the grind just me, the gym, and the fundamentals. I barely touched the floor during varsity games, but I was focused on just getting my foot in the door. By sophomore year, we were on our fourth coach in four years, which was exhausting, but this one actually stuck around. I finally started finding my groove on varsity, mostly because I realized I could be a nightmare on defense. There was nothing better than seeing a star ball-handler get visibly flustered as soon as I picked them up. We finished that season with a winning record, though I ended up fracturing my ankle in the final game, which was a tough way to go out.

By junior year, everything just clicked. We took things up a few notches, and with a coach who actually cared about us as people, the team started feeling more like a family. We were hanging out after practice and helping each other with homework, and that chemistry translated directly to the court. I was starting on varsity and playing the best basketball of my life, leading the way both on defense and offense. It wasn't just about the stats anymore it was about playing for the people standing next to me. All that work—the coaching changes, the injuries, and the late-night practices—finally peaked during my senior year when we finally walked away with the trophy. Looking back, it’s wild to see how we went from a struggling program to champions just by refusing to quit on each other.
